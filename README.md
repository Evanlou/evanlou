### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Yifeng Liu

I am a city planning and data science student, with a focus on Urban Informatics. Having graduated in Architecture from Tsinghua University, I bring design thinking into my studies of social networks and their relationship with our physical surroundings. 

Currently, I work as a research assistant at the Future Urban AI Lab, where I explore artificial intelligence applications in urban planning. And I will enroll in DUSP as a MCP student this September.
